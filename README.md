Project 1 — Credit Assessment Memorandum: Funding Circle plc

A full credit assessment memo on Funding Circle (LSE: FCH), 
a UK-listed SME lending platform, written in the style of a 
junior credit analyst.

Covers:
- Automated data pipeline pulling live financials via yfinance
  with manual overrides from audited annual report (Notes 11, 12, 16)
- Three-year financial analysis (2023–2025): twelve ratios covering
  profitability, efficiency, credit quality, leverage and liquidity
- ICR and DSCR calculated from first principles using SONIA + spread
  methodology justified from Note 16 of the 2025 Annual Report
- Internal risk grade: B- assigned via systematic scoring model
- Covenant package: minimum ICR 1.0x, maximum D/E 2.0x, 
  tested quarterly
- Stress scenario: base, downside, severe — moderate stress triggers
  ICR covenant breach
- Proposed facility structure: £75m revolving credit, 1 year, 
  SONIA + 280bps, first charge over loan book
- Validated against analyst consensus (5 Buy recommendations) and
  Bank of England Financial Stability Report 2025

Key finding: ICR of 1.14x leaves minimal buffer — moderate stress 
triggers covenant breach, supporting B- grade and Cautious Hold.

Tools used: Python, pandas, yfinance, Jupyter, Excel
Data sources: yfinance, Funding Circle 2025 Annual Report, 
BoE Financial Stability Report 2025
